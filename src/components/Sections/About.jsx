      <p>
        My journey in programming began in 2021. Thanks to YouTube recommendations, I completed a short introductory course on the fundamentals of &quot;Python&quot;, and it changed my life.

      <p>
        In March of this year I finished my studies at the &quot;Hexlet&quot; programming school, but I continue to develop as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working with graphic design and UX/UI, as well as solving complex problems. I am always ready to learn and enhance my skills.
